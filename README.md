# Interactive Analytical Web-based Platform for Exploring the Times Higher Education World University Ranking

More or less, we all like rankings, and we all make rankings. One of the most popular subject for ranking is reputation of universities. Although people have been arguing over their credibility and validity for years, university rankings are still considered as an important factor during the application phase. However, there have already been tens of various national and international ranking systems avaiable right now, and all of them somehow disagree with each other. This is because different ranking systems emphasize different things and use different ranking mechanisms. Therefore, before referencing a rank, we should be aware of which factors are included and how they affect the results.

In this project, I do not intend to develop a novel ranking system; instead, I try to analyse the Times Higher Education World University Rankings to discover some interesting patterns. Founded in the United Kingdom in 2010, it is praised for having a new improved methodology; nevertheless, it has also been criticized for its commercialization and for undermining non-English-instructing institutions. The data was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/world-university-rankings.

The best way to explore this platform is of course directly run it. Enter the "src" folder, and use:


```
python app.py
```

Then open a web browser, and use:


```
http://localhost:8888
```

Note that the 8888 is the port number which you should refer to the output of the last command.

For more information, for example how the data was processed, what each section is doing, etc, please refer to the report.
